<h1>Best Movies of All Time by Precious</h1>
<h2>Top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Better Days ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
<p>
  I'm not sure if I watched a lot of chinese movies in the past but this one was
  beautifully crafted. The actors and how they acted made the movie wholesome.
  Let's not forget about the fact that this spreads awareness on one of the
  social issues we have today - bullying. PS. At one point, I was praying it's
  not based on a true story just so I sob less 😆
</p>
<h3>Hacksaw Ridge ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
<p>
  Compared to the first movie I listed, this one is based on a true story. If a
  friend or a stranger would ask me for movie recommendations, I suggest this
  one right off the bat without even knowing their prefered genre and everytime,
  they'd thank me for sharing this masterpiece.

<h3>Man In Love ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
<p>
  The very recent movie I watched which gave me a headache from crying. PS. I
  cry at movies where words aren't enough to describe how great it is.
